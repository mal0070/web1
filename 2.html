  <p>NCT 127 (Korean: 엔시티 127; RR: ensiti il-i-chil; stylized in all caps) is the second sub-unit of the South Korean boy band NCT, formed and currently managed by SMEntertainment. Their unit name is a combination of the acronym for Neo Culture Technology which is the meaning for their parental group's unlimited members, and as the unit is localized in Seoul, hence the number "127" representing the longitude coordinate of the city.</p>
